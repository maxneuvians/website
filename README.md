# OneTeamGov website

This is the source code for [oneteamgov.uk](https://oneteamgov.uk). It is built with the help of the brilliant [Perch Runway](https://perchrunway.com) which was kindly donated to the One Team Government movement by [Drew](https://github.com/drewm) & [Rachel](https://github.com/rachelandrew) of [Edgeofmyseat](https://www.edgeofmyseat.com) an Independant UK software company.

You could download and use this source code to learn or create your own OneTeamGov movement website but you will need to [purchase a license for Perch](https://grabaperch.com/buy) to use it on a live public facing domain.

## Getting set-up

You will need PHP 5.5+, NodeJS (latest).
